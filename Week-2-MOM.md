**Things which are done in Week-2:**
+ We discussed what all things to be improved.
+ So we decided to conduct 4 sessions of meeting in which we can discuss
  all the things to be done.
+ *First Day ( 16-Apr-2021 ):*
  + Week-1 we haved completed creating Login/Signup UI, Online Bus Booking UI and have 
    coded behind the pages using php.
  + Now we have decided to next design Select Your Seat UI(User Interface), Admin Home UI.
  + But To do Admin Home UI, we have to design all the pages like Add Driver UI, Add Buses UI,
    Delete Bus UI, Add Seats UI, Add Stops UI. 
  + So we have decided to design one by one UI and then attach all the pages to the 
    Admin Home UI.
+ *Second Day ( 18-Apr-2021 ):*
  + We have started coding the Select Your Seat UI, Add Driver UI, Add Buses UI and then
    coded behind the pages using php. Also created some css files so that the interface could
    have all the borders, boxes and the colours to represent some specific options.
  + Divided this work among Ourselves and now we can take a look at our backlog which specifies
    our work.
+ *Third day ( 19-Apr-2021 ):*
  + We divided the work among ourselves.
  + Dharani decided to take Week-2 Design Diagram which would be helpful in 
    representing overall project in the form of diagram. Also Week-2 MOM which 
    has to be updated. 
  + Aneela decided to add a README which would be helpful for the other users 
    to understand about our project. Also Week-2 backlog which has to be updated.
